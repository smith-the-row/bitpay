    about:
      "Back in 2014, as experienced professional Wall Street traders and investors, Brett K. Rentmeester and other founding members of CoinSignalPro identified a lack of professionalism, trustworthiness, and customer support within the crypto industry. In the following two years, the number of users engaging in cryptocurrency trading increased significantly. Nevertheless, existing exchanges showed little to no improvement. Realizing the seriousness of the problem, the team left Wall Street and founded CoinSignalPro in the summer of 2015. They then dedicated themselves to building a simple, efficient, but most importantly, a trusted cryptocurrency trading platform. Then, on July 2020, the CoinSignalPro platform officially went live.",
